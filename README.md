# Multi-tenant-Wazuh
Tenants in the Wazuh dashboard are containments for saving index patterns,  visualizations, dashboards, and other objects. Tenants are useful for safely sharing your  work with other users. You can control which roles have access to a tenant and whether  those roles have read or write access.
